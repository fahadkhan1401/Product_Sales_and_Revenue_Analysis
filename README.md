Project Name: "Product Sales and Revenue Analysis Dashboard"**
Project Description:
In this project I provide key insights into annual product sales and revenue. It features three main visualizations:

1. Total Units Sold by Year: 
   - A bar graph comparing annual sales performance.
   
2. Product Sales by Year:
   - A breakdown of sales for each product per year.

3. Total Revenue by Manufacturer:
   - A graph showing total revenue generated by each manufacturer.

Objectives:
- To present clear, concise views of sales and revenue data.

This project utilizes Excelâ€™s data visualization capabilities to create an insightful and user-friendly dashboard for data-driven decisions.
